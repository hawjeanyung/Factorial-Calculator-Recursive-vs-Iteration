# 🧮 Recursive vs Iterative Factorial Calculator

## 📌 Overview

The **Recursive vs Iterative Factorial Calculator** is a professional Windows Forms application developed using **C++/CLI**. The application is designed to compute factorial values using both **recursive** and **iterative** approaches, while providing a clear comparison of their performance and behavior. It is intended for educational and analytical purposes, particularly for understanding algorithm design, efficiency, and recursion concepts.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dual Computation Methods**: Calculate factorials using both recursive and iterative algorithms.
* **Performance Comparison**: Measure and display execution time for each method.
* **Step Counter**: Shows the number of steps taken in both recursive and iterative executions.
* **Formula Display**: Dynamically displays the factorial formula (e.g., `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1`).
* **Big Integer Support**: Handles large factorial values beyond standard integer limits.
* **Overflow Detection**: Automatically detects and prevents integer overflow.
* **Clear & Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset inputs and results easily.
* **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Windows Forms for an intuitive and clean user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language**: C++/CLI
* **Framework**: .NET (Windows Forms)
* **IDE**: Visual Studio

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user inputs a non-negative integer.
2. The application computes the factorial using:

   * A **recursive approach** (function calls itself until a base case is reached).
   * An **iterative approach** (loop-based calculation).
3. Execution time and step count for both methods are recorded.
4. Results are displayed side-by-side for easy comparison.

## 🚫 Input Constraints

* Only **non-negative integers** are allowed.
* Large inputs are supported through Big Integer handling, subject to system limitations.

## 🎓 Educational Value

This application helps users:

* Understand the difference between recursion and iteration.
* Visualize performance trade-offs between algorithmic approaches.
* Learn safe handling of large numerical computations.
